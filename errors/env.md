## Missing CLEVER_TOKEN / CLEVER_SECRET environment variable

You need to provide authentication to the Clever Cloud CLI, via two
environment variables:
- `CLEVER_TOKEN`
- `CLEVER_SECRET`

To know where to find those and how to pass them, check out the
[documentation in the README](https://github.com/47ng/actions-clever-cloud#authentication).
